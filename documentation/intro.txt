Introduction
============

This is the documentation for pyphasesym: python implementation of phasesym.
pyphasesym is based on Peter Kovesi's original phasesym algorithm, paper and
code. The original code and papers can be obtained from Peter Kovesi's 
website. For more details reader is referred to Dr.Kovesi's 
`webpage <http://www.csse.uwa.edu.au/~pk/Research/MatlabFns/>`_

Refer [1]_ and [2]_ for further details.

In this package we provide a modularized version of Pete's original matlab code.
Preliminary  unittesting is introduced in this code. This code follows PEP8 and 
pylint specifications. 

The documentation is provided in rst format. The txt files can be compiled to
produce required output format using sphinx. A precompiled pdf (created by 
sphinx) is provided with this package (pyphasesym.pdf)

Prerequisites
-------------

Following python modules are necessary for the use of the code:

* numpy
* scipy
* optparse
